   Spread the sweet potato on a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the smoked paprika.  
   Roast for **20–25 minutes**, turning halfway, until golden.

2. Toss the butter beans with the lemon zest and lemon-infused olive oil. Set aside.

3. Strip the kale from its stalks and tear into a large bowl.  
   Add half the lemon juice and the apple cider vinegar, season with salt and pepper, drizzle with a little olive oil, then **massage well** until softened.

4. Whisk together the **harissa, olive oil, vinegar, maple syrup and water** until smooth and drizzle-able.

5. Slice the avocado and squeeze over the remaining lemon juice.

6. Heat the grains according to the packet instructions.

7. Divide the grains between bowls and top with the roasted sweet potato, butter beans, kale and avocado.  
   Drizzle over the harissa dressing and finish with pickled red onions and the gut-boosting mix.
