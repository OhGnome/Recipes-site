# Greens, Leeks & Eggs

## Ingredients
- 235g spinach  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 800g leeks, trimmed and cut into 1cm slices  
- 6 salad onions, thinly sliced  
- 1 clove garlic, crushed  
- 1 green chilli, finely chopped  
- 1½ tsp ground cumin  
- 1½ tsp ground coriander  
- 25g flat-leaf parsley, leaves roughly chopped  
- 20g dill, leaves roughly chopped  
- 4 eggs  
- ½ tsp seasoning (recommended: Waitrose Super Plant Seasoning)  

**Optional**
- Chilli flakes, to serve  

## Method
1. Boil a kettle. Place the spinach in a colander and pour over the boiling water to wilt. Set aside to drain.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the leeks and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened.
3. Add the salad onions, garlic, chilli, cumin and coriander. Season with salt and cook, stirring often, for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add the wilted spinach, parsley and dill. Stir to combine and cook for a further 5 minutes.
5. Make four wells in the mixture with a spoon. Crack an egg into each well and season lightly.
6. Using a fork, gently swirl the egg whites so they spread slightly into the leek mixture.
7. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook for 4–5 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks still have a wobble.
8. Serve sprinkled with Super Plant Seasoning and/or chilli flakes.
